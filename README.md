# TicTacToe
This repository holds a version of the game TicTacToe. The original console version is included, along with the integrated GUI version.

As per this project, I learned how to use StdDraw to create different shapes and objects such as an "X" (two lines) or an "O" (circle). Depending on how much of the project is done, hopefully the entire GUI, I wish I was able to add different screens for the player to choose between: playing or exiting the game, choosing to be Player 1 or Player 2, etc. In the event the GUI doesn't end up working (due to a while loop with StdDraw.show() error), I hope to eventually get the code to work (GUI and main verison integrated).

In order to run the program, copy the files to an application which supports Java (like Eclipse) and go to the GUIMain class*. Once there, run the program and a GUI will pop up. If you wish to play the console version, visit the Main class and run the file. This will create a console version, basic version of TicTacToe.

*Note: All classes except for stdlib.jar should be copied into the src code file. Stdlib.jar should be pasted on top of the actual file (to be added to Referenced Libraries).
